# Calls + Realtime

## Rules

1. Keep one shared call model for direct, group, note, and task huddles.
2. Preserve scoped participant checks for private calls.
3. Keep launcher drawer-first; full call page is opt-in expansion.
4. Keep activity writes minimal and clear stale presence quickly.
5. Expiry/cleanup must be authoritative (server-verified), not cosmetic.
