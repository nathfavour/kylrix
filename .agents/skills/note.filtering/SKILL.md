# Kylrix Note Filtering Logic

This skill pins the canonical filtering and discovery patterns for notes to prevent AI agents from breaking the specific partitioning required for secure collaboration.

## 1. Primary Notes List (Ownership-Only)
The main Notes page (`/note/notes`) must ONLY display notes explicitly owned by the current user.
- **Filter**: `Query.equal('userId', currentUser.$id)`
- **Intent**: Personal workspace management.
- **Rule**: Never include shared or public notes owned by others here.

## 2. Shared Workspace Partitioning
The Shared workspace (`/note/shared`) discovery is driven by `getSharedNotes()`, which uses a strict inclusion-first model.

### getSharedNotes() Implementation
- **Initial Fetch**: `Query.notEqual('userId', currentUser.$id)`
- **Strict Validation**: Iterate results and filter for documents where the `$permissions` array explicitly contains `user:CURRENT_USER_ID`.
- **Reasoning**: This excludes "Global Public" notes that the user has read access to via `Role.any()` but was never explicitly invited to.

### Tab 0: Private (Collaborator Notes)
- **Source**: `getSharedNotes()`
- **Filter**: `note.isPublic === false`
- **Display**: Notes explicitly shared with the user by others that remain private to that group.

### Tab 1: Public (Owned + Shared Public)
This tab aggregates two distinct categories:
1.  **Owned Public**: The user's own notes where `isPublic === true`. (Fetch: `listPublicNotesByUser(userId)`)
2.  **Explicit Shared Public**: Notes owned by others where `isPublic === true` AND the user is an **explicit collaborator** in `$permissions`. (Fetch: `getSharedNotes()` result where `isPublic === true`)

## Summary Table

| UI Surface | Owner | Public Status | Permission Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Notes UI** | Me | Any | Owner |
| **Shared > Private** | Others | Private | Explicitly named in `$permissions` |
| **Shared > Public** | Me | Public | Owner |
| **Shared > Public** | Others | Public | Explicitly named in `$permissions` |
