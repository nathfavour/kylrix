# Drawer to Sidebar Desktop Translation

## 🏗️ Architectural Layout Mandates

### 1. Orientation & Anchor Mapping
Bottom and top drawers must translate dynamically to sidebars on desktop to respect the screen aspect ratio and optimize visual ergonomics.

* **Mobile Bottom Drawer** maps directly to a **Right Sidebar** on desktop.
  * Mobile: `anchor="bottom"`, width `100%`, height capped at `max 60vh` (`60dvh`).
  * Desktop: `anchor="right"`, height `100dvh` (tall as screen), width `30%` (normal baseline) to `40%` (for high density configurations).
* **Mobile Top Drawer** maps directly to a **Left Sidebar** on desktop.
  * Mobile: `anchor="top"`, width `100%`, height capped at `max 60vh` (`60dvh`).
  * Desktop: `anchor="left"`, height `100dvh` (tall as screen), width `30%` (normal baseline) to `40%` (for high density configurations).

---

### 2. Dimension Standards
* **Drawers (Mobile / Bottom & Top)**:
  * **Width:** `100%` (full screen).
  * **Height:** Around **60% high** (`max-height: 60vh / 60dvh`) to allow users to maintain background context.
* **Sidebars (Desktop / Left & Right)**:
  * **Height:** **100% tall** (`height: 100vh / 100dvh`) spanning from the top of the viewport to the bottom.
  * **Width:** **30% wide** (standard baseline, e.g., 400px - 480px) to **40% wide** (for dashboards, complex inputs, or logs).

---

### 3. Stacked Multi-Step Sidebars
Just as mobile layouts can overlay multiple drawers sequentially (e.g. stacking a Masterpass authentication sheet on top of a repository settings sheet), **desktop layouts must support stacked sidebars**.
* Stacked sidebars overlay sequentially on the same side.
* Ensure z-indexes and backdrops are clean (`keepMounted: false` and `disablePortal: true`) so that unmounting physically cleans up closed steps in the stacked stack.

### 4. Implementation Example (OpenBricks / Tailwind)
Always use responsive media hooks or media queries to compute the `anchor` and drawer panel styles dynamically.

```tsx
import { useMediaQuery, useTheme } from '@/lib/openbricks/primitives';

const theme = useTheme();
const isDesktop = useMediaQuery(theme.breakpoints.up('md'));

// Compute responsive anchor:
const anchor = isDesktop ? 'right' : 'bottom';

// Compute responsive PaperProps styles:
const paperSx = {
  bgcolor: '#161412',
  border: 'none',
  boxSizing: 'border-box' as const,
  ...(isDesktop ? {
    height: '100vh',
    width: '35%',
    maxWidth: '480px',
    borderTopLeftRadius: '26px',
    borderBottomLeftRadius: '26px',
    borderLeft: '1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)',
  } : {
    maxHeight: '90vh',
    width: '100%',
    borderTopLeftRadius: '26px',
    borderTopRightRadius: '26px',
    borderTop: '1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)',
  })
};
```

### 5. Detail Screen Section Hijack Pattern (STRICT)

To heavily de-incentivize navigation and foster a snappy, immersive, application-like feel across the suite, all object details (notes, moments/posts, tasks/goals, events, forms, E2E secrets, tags, E2E chats, calls) must intercept direct page routing and traditional sliding sidebars.

#### Core Behaviors:
1. **Mobile Layout**: Object details are rendered inside a **100% full-screen bottom drawer (`anchor="bottom"`, height `100dvh`)**. This is the **ONLY exception** to the traditional 60% max-height drawer rule. When closed, it physically unmounts from the DOM (`keepMounted: false`, `disablePortal: true`) to mathematically prevent interaction blocking.
2. **Desktop Layout**: Object details temporarily hijack the **rightmost section/column of the screen** (within the multi-column section grid).
3. **Explicit Back Navigation**: Both mobile drawers and desktop hijacked sections must display a prominent, simple, and clean `[Back]` button at the top. Clicking this button clears the hijacked state, returning the panel/drawer to its default contents (e.g. chats, calls, projects, huddles).
4. **Link Sharing Fail-Safe**: Standalone dynamic page routes (e.g., `/post/[id]`, `/note/[id]`, etc.) must remain fully functional for external public link shares, falling back to the standard page layout when loaded directly.

#### Implementation with SectionContext:
Always utilize `activeDetail` inside the global `SectionContext` to manage details hijacking and trigger this pattern seamlessly from list cards or clicks:
```tsx
const { setActiveDetail } = useSection();
setActiveDetail({ type: 'note', id: note.$id, data: note });
```
