# Note Intelligence

## Rules

1. Never leak public-link notes into authenticated feeds/lists.
2. Keep ghost notes isolated from authenticated lists.
3. Prefer existing note relations (`tags`, `note_tags`, collaborators, comments, metadata) over new state models.
4. Use note metadata as the canonical bridge for note-linked task/call context.
5. Enforce owner/collaborator write access on note mutations.
