# KylrixOrganization - Organizaion Local Agent Guide

## 🏗️ Architectural Mandates

### 🚫 IMMUTABLE FILES (STRICT)
- **No internal APIs**: DO NOT introduce new HTTP API routes/endpoints (`app/api/*`, `route.ts`) for in-app flows. This Организация Организации keeps zero extra attack surface and no unnecessary latency.
- **Prefer Internal Methods**: Use existing in-process functions, Server Actions, and SDK helpers instead of exposing new API surfaces.
- **Data Consolidation**: When returning shaped payloads to hydrate multiple UI widgets, use Server Actions or consolidated internal service methods.

### 🛑 MANDATORY SOURCE CONTROL RESTRICTIONS
- **NO GIT COMMITS**: DO NOT run `git commit`, `git add`, `git stage`, `git push`, or `git merge`. You are strictly forbidden from altering the repository index or history.
- **ZERO STAGING**: Never stage changes. All modifications must remain in the working directory only.
- **Sovereign Source Control**: The user manages source control through a separate, external agentic workflow. Any attempt by an in-repo agent to commit code is a violation of system integrity.

### ⚡ Development Standards
- **Canonical App**: Only implement against **`kylrix/`**. Legacy trees at repo root are for reference only.
- **No Tailwind**: Use Material UI (MUI) and Vanilla CSS.
- **Opaque Surfaces**: No gradients or translucent backgrounds on product chrome.
- **PNPM Only**: Always use `pnpm` for package management. NEVER use `npm` or `yarn`.
- **Global Unmount Policy**: Strictly use conditional rendering (`{isOpen && <Component />}`) for all overlays (drawers, modals, sidebars) instead of relying on visibility props. This physically removes the component and its invisible backdrops from the DOM when closed, mathematically preventing interaction blocking.
- **Interactivity Standards**: Use `keepMounted: false` and `disablePortal: true` for all MUI drawers/modals to ensure they stay contained and cleanup correctly.
- **Surgical Execution**: For 'surgical fixes', prioritize direct, high-precision code modifications. Skip build/lint/test cycles unless explicitly instructed to validate. Aim for maximum velocity in resolving identified issues.
- **Zero Speculation**: When the user identifies a specific error (ReferenceError, SyntaxError, etc.), fix exactly that error and stop. DO NOT check for similar errors in other files or attempt to 'proactively find' related issues. Resolve the reported problem surgically and get out of the way immediately.
- **Layman-First**: Prohibit technical jargon (e.g., E2EE, Entropy, Node, Nexus, Decentralized, Agentic) in all UI copy and descriptions. Use simple, direct, layman-friendly English (e.g., Secure, Private, System, Smart). Prioritize accessibility and user adoption over technical metaphors.
- **Terminology Mandate (STRICT)**: Use **"Table"** instead of "Collection" and **"Row"** instead of "Document" in all code, comments, logs, and internal documentation. The Appwrite-native "document" and "collection" terms are deprecated and must never be reintroduced. This applies to method names (e.g., `listRows` over `listDocuments`), variable names, and UI copy.
